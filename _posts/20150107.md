BEIJING – The looting of the Summer Palace in Beijing is one of the most infamous episodes of colonial abuse in China - a humiliation that remains vivid nearly 150 years on.
The auctioning in Paris of two imperial bronze relics that were part of the booty seized by the British in 1860 has opened this wound and become a rallying cry for nationalists.
“The looting of the Summer Palace (Yuanmingyuan) by the French and the English, and the fire started by the British, remains an unforgivable crime in Chinese memory,” Bernard Brizay, author of a book on the subject, told AFP.
“For the French, it would be the same as if the Prussians in 1870 had razed Versailles down to the ground, looted the Louvre (museum) and set fire to the national library, as the Yuanmingyuan was all of those at once,” he said. The looting and burning of the palace was also shocking for foreigners such as the French writer Victor Hugo, who denounced the destruction of this “splendid and sensational museum of the East”.
“I hope there will come a day when France, liberated and cleaned up, will send back this booty to a plundered China.” “Selling these objects that were stolen from us is like pouring salt on the wound,” said Beijing attorney Liu Yang, who was leading the efforts of a group of Chinese lawyers to stop the relics being sold at the Christie’s auction.
However, that has not stopped a French judge from allowing the relics to be sold at the Christie’s auction BEIJING – The looting of the Summer Palace in Beijing is one of the most infamous episodes of colonial abuse in China - a humiliation that remains vivid nearly 150 years on.
